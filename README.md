# Image-to-Text Conversion and Text Correction System

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop an AI-powered system capable of accurately converting written text from uploaded images into digital text and automatically correcting spelling and grammar errors in the converted text.

## Project Scope
This project encompasses the development of an end-to-end system that combines Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to process images containing written text. The system will extract the text from the images and enhance its accuracy and readability through spelling and grammar corrections.

## Tasks
- **OCR Implementation:** Implement Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from images.
- **Text Correction Module:** Develop a module to correct spelling and grammar errors in the extracted text.
- **Integration and Testing:** Integrate the OCR and text correction modules into a cohesive system and thoroughly test its functionality and accuracy.
